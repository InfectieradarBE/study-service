# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### New expressions

- `getStudyEntryTime`: method to retrieve timestamp of the event, when the participant entered the study from the participant state.
- `hasSurveyKeyAssigned`: accepts one string argument with the survey key to be checked for. Return true if the survey key exists in the assigned surveys array.
- `getSurveyKeyAssignedFrom`:
- `getSurveyKeyAssignedUntil`:
- `hasParticipantFlag`:

### Changed

- Expression `timestampWithOffset` accepts optional second argument as a "reference" time. If left empty, the current time will be used as a reference.
- Expression `timestampWithOffset` accepts and can resolve Expressions for both arguments.
- Survey's version ID is now generated from the current timestamp at submission (instead of a random value). With random generated ID sometimes IDs were re-used and not unique anymore. Simply encoding the current timestamp should be enough for this purpose (Needs to be only unique within the same survey's version history). Also we can save the random number generations computing in this case.
