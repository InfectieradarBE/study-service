Files generated by a test case case are placed here. This file is here to make sure the folder is in GIT to avoid os.Create throwing an error.
Note that all test cases use the same file names, so the last test-case to throw an error will overwrite the files of the previous test-case. It is recommended to debug one test case at once to avoid this.
